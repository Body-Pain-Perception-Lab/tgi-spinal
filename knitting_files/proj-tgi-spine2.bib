	abstract = {Painful burning sensations can be elicited by a spatially-alternating pattern of warm and cold stimuli applied on the skin, the so called “Thermal Grill Illusion” (TGI). Here we investigated whether the TGI percept originates spinally or centrally. Since the inhibition of nociceptive input by concomitant non-nociceptive somatosensory input has a strong spinal component, we reasoned that, if the afferent input underlying the TGI originates at spinal level, then the TGI should be inhibited by a concomitant non-nociceptive somatosensory input. Conversely, if TGI is the result of supraspinal processing, then no effect of touch on TGI would be expected. We elicited TGI sensations in a purely thermal condition without tactile input, and found no evidence that tactile input affected the TGI. These results provide further evidence against a spinal mechanism generating the afferent input producing the TGI, and indicate that the peculiar burning sensation of the TGI results from supraspinal interactions between thermoceptive and nociceptive systems.},

	abstract = {The ‘thermal grill illusion’ refers to paradoxical sensations of heat and pain, resulting from simultaneous application of interlaced warm and cold stimuli to the skin. It provides an interesting model of integrative mechanisms in the nervous system, supposed to be relevant in explaining the hypersensitivity found in chronic pain of unclear etiology. The aim of this study is to investigate the perceptual qualities elicited by a reconstruction of the original grill stimulator and to compare these qualities with those elicited by a single temperature thermode of identical dimensions. Healthy participants performed these comparisons by choosing adjectives describing the perceived sensory qualities. We hypothesized that the thermal grill would be perceived as different from a single temperature hot stimulus near pain threshold because of varying sensory qualities. Moreover, the qualities elicited by the grill were expected to be different from the qualities elicited by its single component temperatures. The thermal grill elicited a complex percept, which was distinguished almost perfect from a hot stimulus. The pattern of perceived qualities of the thermal grill differed from single temperature warm and hot stimuli. Pain-related sensations were less present in the grill percept than in a single hot stimulus near pain threshold. The spectrum of qualities of the grill stimulus changed marginally with stimulus duration by decrease of a cold component and concurrent increase of a heat component. In conclusion, the percept of the thermal grill is not simply pain – it can be understood as a metaesthetic percept at the transition from heat to pain.},

	abstract = {The tract of Lissauer receives small caliber dorsal root fibers in addition to axons arising from dorsal horn neurons. The termination of Lissauer's tract and dorsal root fibers was examined in the C7 segment of the rhesus monkey spinal cord. The distribution of normal dorsal root afferents was mapped by labelling the C7 dorsal root ganglion with tritiated amino acids, and then compared with the degeneration of C7 dorsal root fibers following an intradural dorsal rhizotomy. To focus on the distribution of the small afferents, the degeneration following a Lissau er tractotomy was compared with the degeneration following dorsal rhizotomy and following selected lesions involving the large afferents. The survival times following the lesions and rhizotomies were varied to facilitate identification of groups of fibers and terminals which might degenerate at different rates. Both large and small diameter dorsal root afferents were found to exhibit the same rostrocaudal topography within the dorsal horn. The C7 root axons and terminals distribute throughout the mid-C7 dorsal horn grey. Proceeding rostrally through C6, the majority of the C7 root fibers ending in laminae I-IV shift to a lateral position. Proceeding caudally through C8, the C7 root fibers shift medially. Few of the small diameter C7 afferents entering via Lissauer's tract extend above C6 or below C8. Large diameter C7 afferents, arising as dorsal column collaterals, can extend several segments above and below C7. Autoradiography revealed label in all dorsal horn laminae, the heaviest always occurring in the substantia gelatinosa. After one day, label was absent over dorsal column and Lissauer's tract axons, suggesting that the label was mainly associated with fine axonal branches or possibly terminals. After six to ten days many axons were labelled and could be traced into the dorsal and ventral horn. Degeneration from the rhizotomies and lesions, as demonstrated with Fink-Heimer and Nauta methods, depended on the survival time. No degeneration products were present before three days. The large afferents begin to degenerate within the dorsal horn after three to four days and mainly terminate in laminae IV-VI; by 12 days they can also be traced into the intermediate and ventral grey. The small afferents, which include those serving pain and temperature sensibility, arise from the tract of Lissauer and distribute to laminae I, II and III. The tract of Lissauer consists of two populations, each containing small afferents. One population degenerates at three to five days and distributes mainly to laminae II and III (substantia gelatinosa); the other degenerates around 12 days and distributes mainly to lamina I and the outer zone of II. It is suggested that the exclusive termination of the small afferents to laminae I, II and III may be correlated with certain unique histochemical properties (e.g., high substance P and high opiate receptor binding levels) of these same dorsal horn areas. In addition the early degeneration may involve non-myelinated C afferents and the later degeneration may involve the small myelinated A delta afferents.},

	abstract = {Interlaced cold and warm stimuli may induce a paradoxical burning sensation termed the “thermal grill illusion”. Studies on the grill illusion have yielded contradictory results regarding its quality and intensity, which in turn led to controversies concerning the underlying mechanism. Some controversies may result from testing the illusion with absolute temperatures thereby disregarding inter-subjects’ variation in temperature sensitivity. Therefore, our aim was to measure the individual threshold of the painful grill illusion (PGI). Another aim was to measure, here for the first time, the spatial boundaries of the PGI by spatially separating between the cooling and warming stimuli. Subjects (10 males, 15 females) underwent measurements of heat-pain (HPT) and cold-pain thresholds (CPT) with 9 and 18 cm2 stimulating probes, on the forearm. Subjects also underwent measurement of pain threshold (PT), with one cooling and one heating probe (9 cm2 each) activated simultaneously, and separated by 0–30 cm (distances encompassing one or two dermatomes). Simultaneous cold and warm stimuli produced burning pain at all separation distances. PT (∼26 and 38 °C) was significantly lower than CPT and HPT, respectively, and was relatively fixed across all distances except for 30 cm at which PT increased towards CPT and HPT values. Gender did not affect the PGI. In conclusion, innocuous cold and warm stimuli can spatially summate, both within and between dermatomes and evoke a PGI. Possibly, non-nociceptive channels integrate onto 2nd or 3rd order nociceptive neurons which in turn induce a unique painful burning resulting from the blend of cold and warm sensations.},

In order to localize this unmasking in the human brain, we have used positron emission tomography (PET) to compare the cortical activation patterns evoked by the thermal grill and by cool, warm, noxious cold and noxious heat stimuli. The thermal grill illusion produces activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, whereas its component warm and cool stimuli do not. This area is also activated by noxious heat or cold. Thus, increased activity in the anterior cingulate cortex appears to be selectively associated with the perception of thermal pain. Disruption of thermosensory and pain integration may account for the central pain syndrome that can occur after stroke damage.},

After each stimulus, the subjects had to describe and rate their sensations on visual analog scales. Paradoxical painful sensations, mostly described as burning, were reported by all the subjects but three. However, the phenomenon was less frequent in approximately one third of (‘low responder’) volunteers. The frequency and intensity of such painful sensations were directly related to the magnitude (i.e. 5–25 °C) of the difference of the temperature between the warm and cold bars of the grill. The combination of increasingly colder temperature to a given warm temperature induces similar effects as combining increasingly warmer temperature to a given cold temperature. These results suggest that pain can be the result of a simple addition of non-noxious warm and cold signals.},

Thirty-seven healthy volunteers were tested for 2PDs with 2 stimulus modalities (electrocutaneous and mechanical) and intensity (noxious and innocuous). For each condition, participants received stimuli to either 1 or 2 points on their lower back with different distances (2-14 cm, steps of 2 cm). It was found that 2PDs were significantly smaller for noxious stimuli for both modalities. By contrast, between-modality comparison reproduced previous reports of impaired acuity for noxious stimulation. Higher pain intensities were reported when a larger area was stimulated (SSp), independent of the modality. Furthermore, reported pain intensities were higher when the distance between 2 stimulated areas was increased from 2 to 6 cm (P {\textless} 0.001), 8 cm (P {\textless} 0.01), and 14 cm (P {\textless} 0.01). 2PDs determined by mechanical and electrocutaneous stimuli were significantly correlated within both stimulus intensities, ie, innocuous (r = 0.34, P {\textless} 0.05) and noxious (r = 0.35, P {\textless} 0.05). The current results show 3 novel findings: (1) the precision of the pain system might be higher than in the innocuous (tactile) system when mechanical and electrocutaneous modalities are used, (2) the pattern of distance-based and area-based SSp seems to be comparable irrespective of the modality applied (mechanical and electrocutaneous), and (3) both modalities are moderately correlated.},

          There is a continuum between the paradoxical nonpainful and painful sensations induced by the application of warm and cold stimuli with a thermal grill.
          The simultaneous application of innocuous cutaneous warm and cold stimuli with a thermal grill can induce both paradoxical pain and paradoxical warmth (heat). The goal of this study was to investigate further the relationships between these paradoxical sensations. Stimuli were applied to the palms of the right hands of 21 volunteers with a thermode consisting of 6 bars, the temperature of which was controlled by Peltier elements. We assessed the quality and intensity of the sensations evoked by series of stimuli consisting of progressively colder temperatures combined with a series of given warm temperatures. We applied a total of 116 series of stimuli, corresponding to 785 combinations of warm and cold temperatures. The 2 paradoxical phenomena were reported for most of the series of stimuli (n = 66). In each of these series, the 2 phenomena occurred in the same order: paradoxical warmth followed by paradoxical pain. The difference between the cold–warm temperatures eliciting paradoxical warmth was significantly smaller than that producing paradoxical pain. The intensities of the warmth and unpleasantness evoked by the stimuli were directly related to the magnitude of the warm–cold differential. Our results suggest that there is a continuum between the painful and nonpainful paradoxical sensations evoked by the thermal grill that may share pathophysiological mechanisms. These data also confirm the existence of strong relationships between the thermoreceptive and nociceptive systems and the utility of the thermal grill for investigating these relationships.},

	abstract = {Increased excitability of dorsal horn neurones may play a critical role in producing some pain states and there is evidence that the excitability of neurones lying throughout the dorsal horn is subject to regulation by cells in its most superficial laminae. This paper examines the effect on dorsal horn cell receptive fields and excitability of the specific activation of Lissauer's tract, a tract containing propriospinal axons which arise from cells in the substantia gelatinosa and which project to the substantia of neighbouring spinal segments. Experiments were carried out on anaesthetised spinal rats in the L3-4 spinal segments with microelectrode stimulation on the surface of the Lissauer tract (LT) and microelectrode recording of single cells or small groups of cells that responded to gentle brushing on the skin. Single shocks or brief trains of low-level stimuli to the LT produced a characteristic long-latency dorsal root potential (DRP) on the L3 dorsal root and a brief burst of firing in superficial cells with no stimulation of primary afferents. Generally, this was accompanied by no excitation of deeper dorsal horn cells but commonly by a period of inhibition, often followed by facilitation. We then turned to the effect of long periods (30–90min) of continual LT stimulation because we had seen hints of prolonged facilitation of the deeper cells after periods of such stimulation. Trains of 5 stimuli separated by 2ms and repeated every 200ms were used with individual pulses of 200μs duration and less than 10μA amplitude. This resulted in a shift of the effect on deep cells from primarily inhibition to mainly facilitation. We then examined in detail the effect of these long periods of LT stimulation on the size of receptive fields (RFs) of dorsal horn cells first on single units and then by repeated mapping of the RFs of small groups of cells. Control periods of 60min with no LT stimulation produced no significant RF changes but 30, 60 or 90min of LT stimulation produced successively greater expansions of RFs. When the LT stimulus was turned off after 1h, the RFs remained expanded for at least 2h. The spike height of these cells remained unchanged. The effect was not influenced by the NMDA antagonist MK801 but was imitated by the GABAA antagonist picrotoxin. It is concluded that the prolonged expansion of RFs could not be produced by modulation of descending control since the animals had spinal transections. Neither was it dependent on an NMDA-sensitive mechanism. With these data it is not possible to conclude whether the mechanism is pre-synaptic, post-synaptic or both. It is proposed that the most likely explanation is a decrease in the normal tonic inhibition operated in part by a GABA dependent mechanism. This phenomenon may play a role in prolonged pathological states of increased spinal cord excitability.},

	abstract = {Spatial summation of pain (SSP) is the increase of perceived intensity that occurs as the stimulated area increases. Spatial summation of pain is subadditive in that increasing the stimulus area produces a disproportionately small increase in the perceived intensity of pain. A possible explanation for subadditive summation may be that convergent excitatory information is modulated by lateral inhibition. To test the hypothesis that lateral inhibition may limit SSP, we delivered different patterns of noxious thermal stimuli to the abdomens of 15 subjects using a computer-controlled CO2 laser. Lines (5 mm wide) of variable lengths (4, 8 cm) were compared with 2-point stimuli delivered at the same position/separation as the length of lines. When compared with one-point control stimuli, 2-point stimulus patterns produced statistically significant SSP, while no such summation was detected during line stimulus patterns. Direct comparison of pain intensity evoked by 2-point pattern stimuli with line pattern stimuli revealed that 2-point patterns were perceived as significantly more painful, despite the fact that the 2-point pattern stimulated far smaller areas of skin. Thus, the stimulation of the skin region between the endpoints of the lines appears to produce inhibition. These findings indicate that lateral inhibition limits SSP and is an intrinsic component of nociceptive information processing. Disruption of such lateral inhibition may contribute substantially to the radiation of some types of chronic pain.},

	doi = {10.1002/ejp.1060},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The thermal grill illusion (TGI) refers to the perception of burning heat and often pain that arises from simultaneous cutaneous application of innocuous warm and cool stimuli. This study utilized conditioned pain modulation (CPM) to help elucidate the TGI's underlying neural mechanisms, including the debated role of ascending nociceptive signals in generating the illusion.
METHODS: To trigger CPM, subjects placed the left hand in noxious cold (6 °C) water before placing the right volar forearm onto a thermal grill. Lower pain and unpleasantness ratings of the grill in this CPM run compared to those in a control run (i.e. 33 °C water) were taken as evidence of CPM. To determine whether CPM reduces noxious heat pain and illusory heat pain equally, an experimental group of subjects rated pain and unpleasantness of a grill consisting of innocuous alternating warm (42 °C) and cool (18 °C) bars, while a control group rated a grill with all bars controlled to a noxious temperature (45 °C).
RESULTS: CPM produced significant and comparable reductions in pain, unpleasantness and perceived heat of both noxious heat and the TGI.
CONCLUSIONS: This result suggests that the TGI results from signals in nociceptive dorsal horn convergent neurons, since CPM involves descending inhibition with high selectivity for this neuronal population. More broadly, CPM's ability to produce a shift in perceived thermal sensation of both noxious heat and the TGI from 'hot' to 'warm' implies that nociceptive signals generated by a cutaneous stimulus can contribute to its perceived thermal intensity.
SIGNIFICANCE: Conditioned pain modulation reduces the perceived painfulness, unpleasantness and heat of the thermal grill illusion and noxious heat similarly. The results have important theoretical implications for both types of pain.},

This study examines the contribution of different classes of nerve fibres to this perception. In 40 subjects changes in synthetic heat and thermal perceptions were studied during a 30-min ischaemic nerve block in one reaction time, and one threshold determination task. Synthetic heat stimuli were described as hot or warm, but not as painful, and were preceded by a transient cold. Reaction times for synthetic heat stimuli did not differ from those for cold stimuli. Thresholds for synthetic heat and thermal stimuli were similar. During A fibre nerve block the perception of synthetic heat lost the cold component whereas the frequency of hot and warm descriptors did not change. The perception of cold stimuli changed, such that pure cold was replaced by dysaesthetic descriptors. Reaction times and thresholds for thermal and synthetic heat stimuli increased equally during the nerve block. It is concluded that the perception of synthetic heat most likely arises from the fusion of signals dependent on unmyelinated low threshold cold and warm receptors. It is not dependent on A-delta cold fibres, and a contribution of nociceptors is quite unlikely. The possibility of a psychological contribution at the perceptual level is discussed.},

	abstract = {Objective A common symptom of neuropathy is the misperception of heat and pain from cold stimuli. Similar cold allodynic sensations can be experimentally induced using the thermal grill illusion (TGI) in humans. It is currently unclear whether this interaction between thermosensory and nociceptive signals depends on spinal or supraspinal integration mechanisms. To address this issue, we developed a noninvasive protocol to assess thermosensory integration across spinal segments. Methods We leveraged anatomical knowledge regarding dermatomes and their spinal projections to investigate potential contributions of spinal integration to the TGI. We simultaneously stimulated a pair of skin locations on the arm or lower back using 1 cold (∼20°C) and 1 warm thermode (∼40°C). The 2 thermodes were always separated by a fixed physical distance on the skin, but elicited neural activity across a varying number of spinal segments, depending on which dermatomal boundaries the 2 stimuli spanned. Results Participants consistently overestimated the actual cold temperature on the skin during combined cold and warm stimulation, confirming the TGI effect. The TGI was present when cold and warm stimuli were delivered within the same dermatome, or across dermatomes corresponding to adjacent spinal segments. In striking contrast, no TGI effect was found when cold and warm stimuli projected to nonadjacent spinal segments. Interpretation These results demonstrate that the strength of the illusion is modulated by the segmental distance between cold and warm afferents. This suggests that both temperature perception and thermal–nociceptive interactions depend upon low-level convergence mechanisms operating within a single spinal segment and its immediate neighbors.

Historically, two key questions have dominated the literature: which specific pathway conveys the illusory perceptions of heat and pain, and where, specifically, does the illusory pain originate in the central nervous system? Two major theories - the addition and disinhibition theories - have suggested distinct pathways, as well as specific spinal or supraspinal mechanisms. However, both theories fail to fully explain experimental findings on illusory heat and pain phenomena. We suggest that the disagreement between previous theories and experimental evidence can be solved by abandoning the assumption of one-to-one relations between pathways and perceived qualities. We argue that a population coding framework, based on distributed activity across non-nociceptive and nociceptive pathways, offers a more powerful explanation of illusory heat and pain. This framework offers new hypotheses regarding the neural mechanisms underlying temperature and pain perception.},

Although dendritic organization of lamina I neurons has been extensively studied, little is known about their local axonal morphology and branching. With the help of oblique illumination, we visually identified large lamina I neurons in the isolated lumbar enlargement (L1–L6) of the spinal cord of P14–P20 rats. By using intracellular and cell-attached biocytin injections, we achieved extensive axonal and dendritic labeling in 77 lamina I cells, 40 of which were identified as ALT projection neurons. In the majority of the cases (n = 28), the main axon of these projection neurons gave rise to one or more thin collaterals on the ipsilateral side. Based on their trajectory and location, these collaterals could be divided into three major categories: dorsal, lateral, and ventral. Lamina I projection neurons had dorsal (n = 5), lateral (n = 8), or ventral (n = 6) collaterals only or a combination of these collateral types (n = 9). Our results suggest that lamina I ALT projection neurons can additionally function as local-circuit and propriospinal neurons participating in intra- and intersegmental spinal cord processing. J.

Intracellular recordings were made from such interneurons in anesthetized cats under neuromuscular blockade and with the respiratory drive stimulated by inhaled CO2. The majority of the interneurons were shown by antidromic activation to have axons descending for at least two to four segments, mostly contralateral to the soma. In all, 81\% of the neurons showed postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) to stimulation of intercostal or dorsal ramus nerves of the same segment for low-threshold (≤5T) afferents. A monosynaptic component was present for the majority of the peripherally evoked excitatory PSPs. A central respiratory drive potential was present in most of the recordings, usually of small amplitude. Neurons depolarized in either inspiration or expiration, sometimes variably. The morphology of 17 of the interneurons and/or of their axons was studied following intracellular injection of Neurobiotin; 14 axons were descending, 6 with an additional ascending branch, and 3 were ascending (perhaps actually representing ascending tract cells); 15 axons were crossed, 2 ipsilateral, none bilateral. Collaterals were identified for 13 axons, showing exclusively unilateral projections. The collaterals were widely spaced and their terminations showed a variety of restricted locations in the ventral horn or intermediate area. Despite heterogeneity in detail, both physiological and morphological, which suggests heterogeneity of function, the projections mostly fitted a consistent general pattern: crossed axons, with locally weak, but widely distributed terminations.},

	abstract = {The insular cortex (IC) is an important forebrain structure involved in pain perception and taste memory formation. Using a 64-channel multi-electrode array system, we recently identified and characterized two major forms of synaptic plasticity in the adult mouse IC: long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). In this study, we investigate injury-related metaplastic changes in insular synaptic plasticity after distal tail amputation. We found that tail amputation in adult mice produced a selective loss of low frequency stimulation-induced LTD in the IC, without affecting (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG)-evoked LTD. The impaired insular LTD could be pharmacologically rescued by priming the IC slices with a lower dose of DHPG application, a form of metaplasticity which involves activation of protein kinase C but not protein kinase A or calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. These findings provide important insights into the synaptic mechanisms of cortical changes after peripheral amputation and suggest that restoration of insular LTD may represent a novel therapeutic strategy against the synaptic dysfunctions underlying the pathophysiology of phantom pain.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perceptual illusions play an important role in untangling neural mechanisms underlying conscious phenomena. The thermal grill illusion (TGI) has been suggested as a promising model for exploring percepts involved in neuropathic pain, such as cold-allodynia (pain arising from contact with innocuous cold). The TGI is an unpleasant/painful sensation from touching juxtapositioned bars of cold and warm innocuous temperatures.
AIM: To develop an MRI-compatible TGI-unit and explore the supraspinal correlates of the illusion, using fMRI, in a group of healthy volunteers.
METHODS: We constructed a TGI-thermode allowing the rapid presentation of warm(41°C), cold(18°C) and interleaved(41°C+18°C = TGI) temperatures in an fMRI-environment. Twenty volunteers were tested. The affective-motivational ("unpleasantness") and sensory-disciminatory ("pain-intensity") dimensions of each respective stimulus were rated. Functional images were analyzed at a corrected α-level {\textless}0.05.
RESULTS: The TGI was rated as significantly more unpleasant and painful than stimulation with each of its constituent temperatures. Also, the TGI was rated as significantly more unpleasant than painful. Thermal stimulation versus neutral baseline revealed bilateral activations of the anterior insulae and fronto-parietal regions. Unlike its constituent temperatures the TGI displayed a strong activation of the right (contralateral) thalamus. Exploratory contrasts at a slightly more liberal threshold-level also revealed a TGI-activation of the right mid/anterior insula, correlating with ratings of unpleasantness (rho = 0.31).
CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fMRI-study of the TGI. The activation of the anterior insula is consistent with this region's putative role in processing of homeostatically relevant feeling-states. Our results constitute the first neurophysiologic evidence of thalamic involvement in the TGI. Similar thalamic activity has previously been observed during evoked cold-allodynia in patients with central neuropathic pain. Our results further the understanding of the supraspinal correlates of the TGI-phenomenon and pave the way for future inquiries into if and how it may relate to neuropathic pain.},

	abstract = {Background: Simultaneous presentation of non-noxious warm (40°C) and cold (20°C) stimuli in an interlacing fashion results in a transient hot burning noxious sensation (matched at 46°C) known as the thermal grill (TG) illusion. Functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychophysical assessments were utilized to compare the supraspinal events related to the spatial summation effect of three TG presentations: 20°C/20°C (G2020), 20°C/40°C (G2040) and 40°C/40°C (G4040) with corresponding matched thermode stimuli: 20°C (P20), 46°C (P46) and 40°C (P40) and hot pain (HP) stimuli.
Results: For G2040, the hot burning sensation was only noted during the initial off-line assessment. In comparison to P40, G4040 resulted in an equally enhanced response from all supraspinal regions associated with both pain sensory/discriminatory and noxious modulatory response. In comparison to P20, G2020 presentation resulted in a much earlier diminished/sedative response leading to a statistically significantly (P {\textless} 0.01) higher degree of deactivation in modulatory supraspinal areas activated by G4040. Granger Causality Analysis showed that while thalamic activation in HP may cast activation inference in all hot pain related somatosensory, affective and modulatory areas, similar activation in G2040 and G2020 resulted in deactivation inference in the corresponding areas.
Conclusions: In short, the transient TG sensation is caused by a dissociated state derived from non-noxious warm and cold spatial summation interaction. The observed central dissociated state may share some parallels in certain chronic neuropathic pain states.},

	abstract = {The spinal dorsal horn exhibits a high degree of intrinsic connectivity that is critical to its role in the processing of nociceptive information. To examine the spatial organization of this intrinsic connectivity, we used laser-scanning photostimulation in parasagittal and transverse slices of lumbar spinal cord to stimulate presynaptic neurons by glutamate uncaging, and mapped the location of sites that provide excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input to neurons of the superficial laminae. Excitatory interneuronal connectivity within lamina II exhibited a pronounced sagittal orientation, in keeping with the somatotopic organization present in the pattern of primary afferent projections. Excitatory inputs to all classes of lamina II neurons arose from a wider rostrocaudal area than inhibitory inputs, whereas both excitatory and inhibitory input zones were restricted mediolaterally. Lamina I–II neurons exhibited cell type-specific patterns in the laminar distribution of their excitatory inputs that were related to their dorsoventral dendritic expanse. All cell types received excitatory input predominantly from positions ventral to that of their soma, but in lamina I neurons and lamina II vertical cells this ventral displacement of the excitatory input zone was greater than in the other cell types, resulting in a more pronounced translaminar input pattern. A previously unknown excitatory input to the superficial dorsal horn from lamina III–IV was identified in a subset of the vertical cell population. These results reveal a specific three-dimensional organization in the local patterns of excitatory and inhibitory connectivity that has implications for the processing of information related to both somatotopy and sensory modality.},

	abstract = {The specificity theory of somesthesis holds that perceptions of warmth, cold, and pain are served by separate senses. Although no longer accepted in all its details, the theory's basic assumptions of anatomical and functional specificity have remained guiding principles in research on temperature perception and its relationship to pain. This article reviews the response characteristics of thermoreceptors, temperature-sensitive nociceptors, and their associated pathways in the context of old and new perceptual phenomena, most of which cannot be satisfactorily explained by the specificity theory. The evidence indicates that throughout most of the perceptual range, temperature sensitivity depends upon coactivation of, and interactions among, thermal and nociceptive pathways that are composed of both specific “labeled lines” and nonspecific, multimodal fibers. Adding to this complexity is evidence that tactile stimulation can influence the way in which thermal stimulation is perceived. It is argued that thermoreception is best defined as a functional subsystem of somesthesis that serves the very different and sometimes conflicting demands of thermoregulation, protection from thermal injury, and haptic perception. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {"Synthetic heat", also known as the heat grill illusion, occurs when contact with spatially adjacent warm and cold stimuli produce a sensation of "heat". This phenomenon has been explained as a painful perception that occurs when warm stimulation inhibits cold-sensitive neurons in the spinothalamic tract (STT), which in turn unmasks activity in the pain pathway caused by stimulation of C-polymodal nociceptors (CPNs). The "unmasking model" was tested in experiment 1 by combining warm (35-40 degrees C) and cool ({\textgreater} or = 27 degrees C) stimuli that were too mild to stimulate CPNs. After discovering that these temperatures produced nonpainful heat, experiment 2 was designed to determine whether heat could be induced when near-threshold cooling was paired with mild warmth, and whether lowering the base temperature for cooling would increase the noxious (burning, stinging) components of heat for fixed cooling steps of 1-3 degrees C. Cooling by just 1 degrees C from a base temperature of 33 degrees C led to reports of heat on more than 1/3 of trials, and cooling by just 3 degrees C evoked heat on 75\% of trials. Lowering the base temperature to 31 or 29 degrees C increased reports of heat and burning but did not produce significant reports of pain. Perception of nonpainful heat at such mild temperatures indicates either that cold-sensitive nociceptors with thresholds very similar to cold fibers innervate hairy skin in humans, or that heat can result from integration of warm fiber and cold fiber activity, perhaps via convergence on nonspecific (e.g., WDR) neurons in the STT.},

	abstract = {Aims
This study aimed to investigate the quality of the thermal grill illusion (TGI) and the importance of stimulus parameters (distance between, and number of stimulation bars).
Material and methods
Twenty-one different stimuli were applied to a group of 19 healthy subjects on the glabrous skin over the palm and fingers.
Results
The TGI was found to be painful (19.42\% on the palm; 17.98\% on the fingers), mechanical (25.24\% on the palm; 5.62\% on the fingers), emotional (13.59\% on the palm; 14.61\% on the fingers) or unusual (42.72\% on the palm; 61.8\% on the fingers) sensations. A total of 89.5\% (palm) and 94.4\% (fingers) of the subjects reported TGI. Between 45\% (fingers) and 50\% (palm) of the stimuli elicited TGI. Neither the distance (2 ∼ 10mm) between adjacent warm (40±1°C) and cold (20±1°C) bars nor the number of the stimulation bars (2 ∼ 6) significantly affected the occurrence of the TGI (N.S.). The average reaction time was 2.4±0.1seconds to the TGI sensation. Females showed longer reaction time than males (P≤0.001).
Conclusion
The distance and number of stimulation bars were not important to the sensation of TGI, of which the responses varied. These results are useful for future TGI studies with respect to experimental design. The variability of the TGI needs to be considered in future experimental and clinical studies.
Résumé
But de l’étude
Cette étude a pour objet d’analyser qualitativement l’illusion de la grille thermale (IGT) et l’importance des paramètres de stimulation (nombre de barres de stimulation et intervalles entre celles-ci).
Matériel et méthode
Vingt et un stimuli différents ont été utilisés sur un groupe de 19 personnes en bonne santé. Les stimuli ont été appliqués sur une partie de peau lisse et glabre des paumes et des doigts.
Résultats
Les sensations de la IGT ont été définies comme : douloureuses (paume : 19,42 \% ; doigts : 17,98 \%), mécaniques (paume : 25,24 \% ; doigts : 5,62 \%), émotionnelles (paume :13,59 \%; doigts : 14,61 \%) ou inhabituelles (paume : 42,72 \% ; doigts : 61,8 \%). Un total de 89,5 \% (paume) et 94,4 \% (doigts) des sujets font état de sensations IGT. Entre 45 \% (doigts) et 50 \% (paume) font état des stimuli provoqués par la IGT. Ni l’intervalle (2 ∼ 10mm) entre les barres chaudes (40±1°C) et froides (20±1°C) voisines ni le nombre de barres de stimulation (2 ∼ 6) n’ont affecté de façon significative l’incidence de la IGT (N.S.). Le temps de réaction moyen à la sensation IGT a été de 2,4±0,1secondes. Les femmes ont montré un temps de réaction plus long que les hommes (p≤0,001).
Conclusion
L’intervalle entre les barres et le nombre de barres de stimulation n’ont pas eu d’importance pour la sensation de la IGT, compte tenu de la variation des réponses. Ces résultats peuvent aider à la conception expérimentale de futures études IGT. La variabilité de la IGT doit être prise en considération dans de futures études cliniques expérimentales.},
