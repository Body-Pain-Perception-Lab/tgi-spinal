# Now to model effects! Try a zero inflated regression model
```{r}
# First model cold VAS
model.cold = glmmTMB::glmmTMB(beta ~ manipulation + condition + cold_location + trial_n +
                                (1|ID),
                      family = glmmTMB::beta_family(),
                      ziformula = ~1+manipulation,
                      data = df_VAS[df_VAS$VAS == 'cold' ,])
# then model warm VAS
model.warm = glmmTMB::glmmTMB(beta ~ manipulation + condition + cold_location + trial_n +
                                (1|ID),
                      family = glmmTMB::beta_family(),
                      ziformula = ~1+manipulation,

# model summaries
summary(model.cold)
summary(model.warm)
```
# Look at model assumptions
```{r}
# cold assumption
model.cold.assmup <- simulateResiduals(model.cold)
plot(model.cold.assmup)
```

```{r}
# warm assumption
model.warm.assump <- simulateResiduals(model.warm)
plot(model.warm.assump)
```

# Run power analysis - to do this use the simplest model (model.cold)
# First, Create a model with more data points per variable, to extract more power
```{r}
# First, let's try to add 30 observations per variable combination, which would mean N = 30
model.coldN <- extend(model.cold, within = 'manipulation+condition+cold_location', n=30)
summary(model.coldN)
# check that number of data points per variable does = 30
dat_model <- xtabs(~ manipulation + condition + cold_location, data=getData(model.coldN))
print(dat_model)
```

# Run power analysis!
````{r, results = 'hide'}
# extract fixed effects from the model - take the lowest effect size from the model
tgi_effect <- fixef(model.coldN)["manipulationTGI"]
cond_effect <- fixef(model.coldN)["conditionwithin"]
cold_loc_effect <- fixef(model.coldN)["cold_locationprox_caud"]
# need to estimate minimum desired effect from the change in slope - considering values can range from 0-100, it might be simpler to think of these effect sizes as a proportion of 100 instead
# tgi_effect = -17.05 would perhaps leave an expected effect size of .17
# change the effect size to effect size of interest
fixef(model.coldN)["cold_locationprox_caud"] <- cold_loc_effect

# then run power analysis
pwr.cold <- powerSim(model.coldN)
print(pwr.cold)
```

Now to run a power curve on the data to find out the optimal number of participants needed for the effect of interest
```{r}
# can run a power curve to determine the point of trade off between N observations and power
pc.cold <- powerCurve(model.coldN, within='manipulation+condition+cold_location', 
                      breaks= seq(1, 30, by = 3))
print(pc.cold)
```

# Plot power curve!
```{r}
plot(pc.cold) # a good visualisation :)
```

Now let's do the same for warm!
# Warm model
```{r}
model.warm <- lmerTest::lmer(rating ~ manipulation + condition + cold_location +
                     (1|ID),
                   data = df_sum[df_sum$VAS == 'warm' ,])
summary(model.warm)
```

# Extend the model observations to n = 50, and extract smallest effect size of interest
```{r}
# using n050 here as expecting smaller effect sizes
model.warmN <- extend(model.warm, within = 'manipulation+condition+cold_location', n=50)
# extracting effect sizes from the extended model
tgi_effect <- fixef(model.warmN)["manipulationTGI"]
cond_effect <- fixef(model.warmN)["conditionwithin"]
cold_loc_effect <- fixef(model.warmN)["cold_locationprox_caud"]
# add smallest effect size - same as cold model
fixef(model.coldN)["cold_locationprox_caud"] <- cold_loc_effect

# then run power analysis
pwr.warm <- powerSim(model.warmN)
print(pwr.warm)
```
# Run a power curve on these data with n = 50
```{r}
# can run a power curve to determine the point of trade off between N observations and power
pc.warm <- powerCurve(model.warmN, within='manipulation+condition+cold_location', 
                      breaks= seq(1, 50, by = 5))
print(pc.warm)
```
